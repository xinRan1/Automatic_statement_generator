In this project, I built a model to mimic the writing style of British Mathematician, Bertrand Russell with help of machine learning techniques and LSTM. 

Folders:
- data includes four texts written by Russell; for each one, I removed some publication informaton.
- notebook includes codes.
- weights_files includes the weights' files generated while LSTM training.
